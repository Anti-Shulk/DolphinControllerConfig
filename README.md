# DolphinControllerConfig
This is a controller Configurator I built for Dolphin in Qt. It should work on Windows as well as many Linux distros. On windows any evdev or sdl device should work, and on windows any xinput device should work.
 If you want to use Playstation controller or Nitnendo Switch controllers, there are two cool projects called DS4Windows and BetterJoy which will convert these into xinput. It also allows for rumble, controller leds, and motion controls, so I would reccomend using them with dolphin anyway.
